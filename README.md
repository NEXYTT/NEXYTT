### Hi there, I'm @NEXYTT 👋

I'm a passionate developer enthusiast focused on **Artificial Intelligence** and **Game Architecture**. I love digging into how games work under the hood to build custom internal & external tools.

- 👀 I’m interested in **Game Hacking (Reverse Engineering)**, **AI Development**, and creating **Modding Tools**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **C++**, **C#**, **Python**, and **Memory Management**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **Open Source Game Tools** or **AI automation projects**.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Aquí puedes poner tu Discord o Email si quieres]
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I spend more time building tools for games than actually playing them.
